I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at The Ohio State University, working under the guidance of my co-advisors, [Dr. Zhiqiang Lin](https://zhiqlin.github.io/) and [Dr. Carter Yagemann](https://carteryagemann.com/). My research interests lie in program analysis, focusing on both binary and source code levels for vulnerability detection. I am particularly interested in utilizing static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect difficult-to-model and detect logical vulnerabilities in memory-safe languages, as the world increasingly shifts away from native memory-unsafe languages.

I am a Bangladeshi and Muslim, with a deep-rooted passion for computer science. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the University of Dhaka in 2019. Following my graduation, I worked as a software engineer for two years, honing my skills and gaining valuable industry experience.

In 2021, I decided to further my education and research pursuits by starting my PhD journey at The Ohio State University. With the support and mentorship of my co-advisors, I am dedicated to advancing the field of program analysis and contributing to the development of more secure software systems.
