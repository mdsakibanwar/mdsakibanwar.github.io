I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at The Ohio State University, where I work under the guidance of my co-advisors, [Dr. Zhiqiang Lin](https://zhiqlin.github.io/) and [Dr. Carter Yagemann](https://carteryagemann.com/). My research focuses on program analysis at both the binary and source code levels, with a particular emphasis on vulnerability detection. I am especially interested in exploring static and dynamic analysis techniques to uncover complex logical vulnerabilities in memory-safe languages, a growing area of importance as the software industry moves away from traditional memory-unsafe languages.

I am originally from Bangladesh and identify as a practicing Muslim. My passion for computer science is both personal and deeply rooted. I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the University of Dhaka in 2019. After graduation, I worked as a software engineer for two years, gaining practical industry experience that continues to inform my research.

In 2021, I began my PhD journey at The Ohio State University, driven by a desire to contribute to the development of secure and robust software systems. With the continued mentorship of my advisors, I am committed to advancing the state of the art in program analysis.

**I am actively seeking opportunities in academia**, including **postdoctoral positions** and **tenure-track roles as an Assistant Professor**. I am eager to bring my research expertise, teaching experience, and collaborative mindset to an academic institution where I can continue to make meaningful contributions in both research and education.

If you are aware of any suitable openings or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!
