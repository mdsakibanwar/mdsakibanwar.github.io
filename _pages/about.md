I am a Bangladeshi and Muslim, with a deep-rooted passion for computer science. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the University of Dhaka in 2019. Following my graduation, I worked as a software engineer for two years, honing my skills and gaining valuable industry experience.

In 2021, I decided to further my education and research pursuits by starting a PhD in Computer Science at The Ohio State University. I am currently working under the guidance of my co-advisors, Dr. Zhiqiang Lin and Dr. Carter Yagemann.

My research interests are centered around program analysis, focusing on both binary and source code levels for vulnerability detection. I am particularly interested in utilizing and improving state-of-the-art static and dynamic analysis techniques. My current research aims to detect difficult-to-model and detect logical vulnerabilities in memory-safe languages, as the world increasingly shifts away from native memory-unsafe languages.
