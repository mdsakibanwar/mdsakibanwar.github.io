As a Teaching Assistant for CSE 1222: Introduction to C++ Programming, I enhanced students' learning experiences by conducting interactive lab sessions, demonstrating coding techniques, and providing hands-on guidance through exercises and projects. I also managed a team of graders, ensuring timely and fair assessment of student work, and assisted in grading exams.
