As a Teaching Assistant for CSE 1222: Introduction to C++ Programming, I enhanced students' learning experiences by conducting interactive lab sessions, demonstrating coding techniques, and providing hands-on guidance through exercises and projects. Specifically, being online helping students create an environment that they can be productive in was essential.
